Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD candidate at [Computing Systems Laboratory](www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr) of the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](www.ece.ntua.gr), [NTUA](www.ntua.gr).  My advisors are Professor [Georgios Goumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/) and researcher [Vasileios Karakostas](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~vkarakos/). My research interests lie on the fields of computer architecture and operating systems and especially:
* virtual memory
* emerging memory/storage technologies
* virtualization
* memory compression


Prior to my PhD studies, I was employed as a research assistant at [Chalmers Univeristy of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) under the supervision of professor [Per Stenstrom](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~pers/). 
My main research area was system software support for main memory compression. 
Research findings of the team led to the foundation of [ZeroPoint Technologies AB](https://wp.zptcorp.com/),
a start-up company designing novel memory compression technology, where I was employed as
a system software engineer for a year. I still maintain collaboration with ZeroPoint
as we work jointly on EU2020 project [EuroExa](https://euroexa.eu/).
