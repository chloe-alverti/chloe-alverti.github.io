Welcome to my homepage! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with [Prof. Josep Torellas](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/torrella)
and the [i-acoma group](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) as part of the [ACE research center](https://acecenter.grainger.illinois.edu/)! I received my PhD in Computer Engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Prof. Georgios Goumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/) and [Prof. Vasileios Karakostas](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~vkarakos/) as a member of the [Computing Systems Laboratory (CSLAB)](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/).

My research interests generally lie on the fields of computer architecture and operating systems and especially on: i) virtual memory, ii) HW/SW co-design, iii) new memory/storage technologies and iv) virtualization. 
Currently, I find the resurgence of research around Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) systems fascinating. A key enabler to this direction has been the emergence of new hardware cache coherent links/technologies, like CXL 3.0.
My current research is focused on HW/SW co-design for efficient pragmatic DSM access. 
 
During my PhD studies I've spent three months at UW-Madison on a research visit, working with professor [Michael Swift](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/) and the [SCAIL](https://scail.cs.wisc.edu/) group on persistent memory. 
Prior to my PhD studies, I was employed as a research assistant at [Chalmers Univeristy of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) under the supervision of professor [Per Stenstrom](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~pers/). 
My main research area was system software support for main memory compression and this [granted patent](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&date=20210518&DB=&locale=en_EP&CC=SE&NR=543649C2&KC=C2&ND=4) summarizesour work.

Research findings led to the foundation of [ZeroPoint Technologies AB](https://wp.zptcorp.com/), a start-up company designing novel memory compression technology, where I was employed as system software engineer.

Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD candidate at [Computing Systems Laboratory](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr) of the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ntua.gr), [NTUA](http://www.ntua.gr).  
My advisors are Professors [Georgios Goumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/) and [Vasileios Karakostas](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~vkarakos/). 
My research interests lie on the fields of computer architecture and operating systems and especially:

* virtual memory
* HW/SW co-design
* emerging memory/storage technologies
* virtualization

The past few years I've focused on novel non-volatile main memory technologies and specifically on the design of efficient OS support for persistet data access.
I've spent three months at UW-Madison on a research visit, working with professor [Michael Swift](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/) and the [SCAIL](https://scail.cs.wisc.edu/) group. 
Our work has been recently accepted on [MICRO2022](/publications/micro2020-daxvm)! 

The first years of my PhD I worked on the address translation overhead problem, experimenting
with HS/SW solutions, and part of our work was published in [ISCA 2020](/publications/isca2020-contiguity)!

I'm also interested in novel non-volatile main memory technolÎ¿gy and I'm currently working on the design of 
efficient operating system (OS) support for persistent data access. 

Prior to my PhD studies, I was employed as a research assistant at [Chalmers Univeristy of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) under the supervision of professor [Per Stenstrom](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~pers/). 
My main research area was system software support for main memory compression. 
Research findings led to the foundation of [ZeroPoint Technologies AB](https://wp.zptcorp.com/), a start-up company designing novel memory compression technology, where I was employed as
a system software engineer for a year. This [granted patent](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&date=20210518&DB=&locale=en_EP&CC=SE&NR=543649C2&KC=C2&ND=4) summarizes our work. 
I still maintain collaboration with ZeroPoint
as we work jointly on EU2020 project [EuroExa](https://euroexa.eu/).
