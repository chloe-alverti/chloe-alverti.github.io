Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD candidate at [Computing Systems Laboratory](www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr) of the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](www.ece.ntua.gr), [NTUA](www.ntua.gr).  My advisor is Assistant Professor [Georgios Goumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/) and I work closely with researcher [Vasileios Karakostas](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~vkarakos/). My research interests are on computer architecture and operating systems and more specifically lie in the following areas:
** virtual memory
** emerging memory/storage technologies
